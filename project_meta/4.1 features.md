# CityPulse v4.1 - The "Positive Spin & Player Aid" Update

## Overview
Version 4.1 focuses on refining the narrative depth of "Bad Cards" to make them strategically deceptive and improving player accessibility with in-game tutorials.

## Key Features

### 1. "Positive Spin" Advisor Mechanics
To prevent "Bad Cards" (Failures) from being too obvious to reject, the Advisor prompts have been rewritten as "Devil's Advocate" arguments.
*   **Concept**: Advisors now sell the *short-term benefits* (efficiency, speed, revenue) of bad policies, forcing players to see past the spin.
*   **Examples**:
    *   *Gated Enclave*: Tempts with "wealthy investors" and "tax revenue" (hiding social segregation).
    *   *Concrete Canal*: Tempts with "fastest drainage efficiency" (hiding biodiversity loss).
    *   *Dormitory Town*: Tempts with "peace and quiet" (hiding tidal flow traffic).

### 2. Feature Card "Deep Dives"
Enhanced context for major DMP2025 features to better explain their strategic value.
*   **Recreation Master Plan**: Emphasizes activating "dead spaces" (rooftops, viaducts) to gain Livability without using Land.
*   **PLAB Relocation**: explicitly mentions the "Ceiling Lift" effect—unlocking height limits for surrounding towns.

### 3. "How to Play" System
A new in-game modal accessible via the top-left "Book" icon.
*   **Core Mechanics**: Explains Swiping, Resource Management, and the 15-year cycle.
*   **Problem-Solution Engine**: Clarifies how Crises lock stats and how Solution Cards unlock them.
*   **Winning Conditions**: Explains Game Over states (0 resources) and Victory (S-Rank).

## Technical Updates
*   **Codebase**: Added `HowToPlayModal.jsx` and updated `GameEngine.jsx`.
*   **Data**: Refined `cards.js` with new advisor text strings.
