# Gameplay Features (v4.0)

Version 4.0 introduces deep gameplay mechanics to enhance player engagement and educational value, focusing on **Resilience and Crisis Management**.

## 1. Scenario-Based Campaigns
Before starting, players choose a "Scenario" that defines the city's context.
- **The Standard Run**: Default settings.
- **The Silver Tsunami**: High elderly population. Health is harder to maintain. Focuses on social infrastructure.
- **Climate Siege**: Frequent extreme weather events. Resilience is key. Focuses on climate adaptation.

## 2. Persistent Crisis & Resolution
Crises are now sticky status effects rather than one-time events.
- **Trigger**: Random chance or specific bad decisions (e.g., ignoring green buffers).
- **Impact**: While active, crises drain resources (e.g., -5 Budget/Turn).
- **Resolution**: Players must find and play specific **Solution Cards** (blue border) to solve the crisis (e.g., "Deployed ABC Waters" fixes Floods).

## 3. Gamified End Game Review (ImpactLedger)
The old "Transparency Portal" list has been replaced with a comprehensive **Performance Review**.

### Grading System
Players receive a grade based on the strategic accuracy of their decisions (matching DMP2025 principles).
- **S Rank (Visionary Minister)**: >90% Strategic Accuracy.
- **A Rank (Chief Planner)**: >75% Strategic Accuracy.
- **B Rank (Town Planner)**: >50% Strategic Accuracy.
- **C Rank (Intern)**: >30% Strategic Accuracy.
- **F Rank (Fired)**: <30% Strategic Accuracy.

### Key Highlights Analysis
The game analyzes the player's session and highlights 3 key decisions:
- **Mistakes**: Approving a "Bad Card" (e.g., Gated Enclave) or Rejecting a "Good Card" (e.g., Long Island).
- **Great Moves**: Correctly identifying high-value strategic cards.
- **Context**: Each highlight includes an educational snippet explaining *why* the move was good or bad.

## 4. Citizen Voice Bonus (Feedback Mechanic)
To simulate the importance of public engagement in urban planning, a dynamic bonus mechanic has been added.

### Mechanics
- **Town Halls**: "Press Conference" cards appear periodically (Max 2/game).
- **Interaction**: A text input field requires players to justify their policy stance.
- **Objective**: Simulates the communication aspect of being a planner.
- **Reward**: Submitting feedback grants an immediate resource boost.

## 5. Visual & UX Enhancements
### DMP2025 Color Themes
To align with the Master Plan pillars and improve accessibility, cards are color-coded by theme:
- 🟧 **Social (Happy, Healthy)**: Orange (e.g., 10-Minute Neighbourhood)
- 🟦 **Economy (Sustainable Growth)**: Blue (e.g., JLD Gateway)
- 🟦 **Resilience (Climate)**: Cyan (e.g., Long Island, Cooling System)
- 🟪 **Heritage (Identity)**: Purple (e.g., Identity Corridor, Chencharu)
- 🟪 **Connectivity (Smart Infra)**: Indigo (e.g., Smart Sensors, RTS Link)

### Bad Cards
"Failure" cards (e.g., Gated Enclave) now use the color of their respective theme rather than a generic red, requiring players to read the context rather than relying on visual cues.
