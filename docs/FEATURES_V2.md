# New Gameplay Features (v2.0)

Version 2.0 introduces deep gameplay mechanics to enhance player engagement and educational value.

## 1. Gamified End Game Review (ImpactLedger)
The old "Transparency Portal" list has been replaced with a comprehensive **Performance Review**.

### Grading System
Players receive a grade based on the strategic accuracy of their decisions (matching DMP2025 principles).
- **S Rank (Visionary Minister)**: >90% Strategic Accuracy.
- **A Rank (Chief Planner)**: >75% Strategic Accuracy.
- **B Rank (Town Planner)**: >50% Strategic Accuracy.
- **C Rank (Intern)**: >30% Strategic Accuracy.
- **F Rank (Fired)**: <30% Strategic Accuracy.

### Key Highlights Analysis
The game analyzes the player's session and highlights 3 key decisions:
- **Mistakes**: Approving a "Bad Card" (e.g., Gated Enclave) or Rejecting a "Good Card" (e.g., Long Island).
- **Great Moves**: Correctly identifying high-value strategic cards.
- **Context**: Each highlight includes an educational snippet explaining *why* the move was good or bad (e.g., "Gated Enclaves destroy social cohesion").

### Collapsible Log
The full list of decisions is still available but tucked away in a "View All Decisions" dropdown to reduce visual clutter.

- **Objective**: The player can type a reason, opinion, or slogan related to the card.

## 3. Deck Randomization & Replayability
