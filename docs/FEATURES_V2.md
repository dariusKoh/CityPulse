# New Gameplay Features (v2.0)

Version 2.0 introduces deep gameplay mechanics to enhance player engagement and educational value.

## 1. Gamified End Game Review (ImpactLedger)
The old "Transparency Portal" list has been replaced with a comprehensive **Performance Review**.

### Grading System
Players receive a grade based on the strategic accuracy of their decisions (matching DMP2025 principles).
- **S Rank (Visionary Minister)**: >90% Strategic Accuracy.
- **A Rank (Chief Planner)**: >75% Strategic Accuracy.
- **B Rank (Town Planner)**: >50% Strategic Accuracy.
- **C Rank (Intern)**: >30% Strategic Accuracy.
- **F Rank (Fired)**: <30% Strategic Accuracy.

### Key Highlights Analysis
The game analyzes the player's session and highlights 3 key decisions:
- **Mistakes**: Approving a "Bad Card" (e.g., Gated Enclave) or Rejecting a "Good Card" (e.g., Long Island).
- **Great Moves**: Correctly identifying high-value strategic cards.
- **Context**: Each highlight includes an educational snippet explaining *why* the move was good or bad (e.g., "Gated Enclaves destroy social cohesion").

### Collapsible Log
The full list of decisions is still available but tucked away in a "View All Decisions" dropdown.
- **Open-Ended Inputs**: "Citizen Voice" and "Press Conference" answers are highlighted with the original question and your typed response.
- **Standard Choices**: Displayed as a concise log to keep the review clean.

## 2. Citizen Voice Bonus (Feedback Mechanic)
To simulate the importance of public engagement in urban planning, a dynamic bonus mechanic has been added.

### Mechanics
- **Chance**: Every card has a **10%** chance to trigger a "Citizen Voice" event.
- **Interaction**: A text input field appears on the card.
- **Objective**: The player can type a reason, opinion, or slogan related to the card.
- **Reward**: Submitting feedback grants an immediate boost (+100 CP, +5 to all stats).
- **Audit**: Your feedback is saved and displayed in the End Game Review.

## 3. Visual & UX Enhancements
### DMP2025 Color Themes
To align with the Master Plan pillars and improve accessibility (distinguishing cards from the Red/Green swipe indicators), cards are now color-coded by theme:
- 🟧 **Social (Happy, Healthy)**: Orange (e.g., 10-Minute Neighbourhood)
- 🟦 **Economy (Sustainable Growth)**: Blue (e.g., JLD Gateway)
- 🟦 **Resilience (Climate)**: Cyan (e.g., Long Island, Cooling System)
- 🟪 **Heritage (Identity)**: Purple (e.g., Identity Corridor, Chencharu)
- 🟪 **Connectivity (Smart Infra)**: Indigo (e.g., Smart Sensors, RTS Link)

### Bad Cards
"Failure" cards (e.g., Gated Enclave) now use the color of their respective theme rather than a generic red, requiring players to read the context rather than relying on visual cues.

## 4. Deck Randomization & Replayability
- **Fixed Length**: Game length is capped at **15 Cards** per session.
- **Dynamic Pool**: 30+ cards in the total pool.
- **Scenario Injection**: Cards are weighted based on the active Scenario.
